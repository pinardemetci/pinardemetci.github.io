# Some thoughts on self care during graduate school (or anyone)

I have been reflecting on my graduate school experience and how I have continually changed as a person over the course of the last three years since I started graduate school. I am hoping these take-aways help 

I rediscovered my joyful side when I started to
A Ph.D. in my field takes an average of 5 - 5.5 years and most people are in their mid- or late-20s during this period. This is a relatively long time during a period of life that's still quite transformative and quickly changing.
