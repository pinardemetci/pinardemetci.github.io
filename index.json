Hi-C is a type of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay which can be used to study the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009). Analysis of Hi-C data can reconstruct the building blocks that give rise to or result from the organizational principles of the genome: topologically associating domains (TADs), transcriptionally active compartments, chromatin loops, chromosomal territories (Gibcus \u0026 Dekker 2013). Recent studies comparing TAD-finding methods (Forcato et al. 2017, Dali \u0026 Blanchette 2017) found the methods to vary significantly in their replicability and stability across sequence depth, sparsity, and resolution of the input data, suggesting the need for more robust methods. Here we present GRiNCH, an approach based on Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify organizational units of chromosomes from Hi-C data. NMF is a powerful dimensionality-reduction technique that can recover low-dimensional representations of images, texts, and biological data (Lee \u0026 Seung 2000). GRiNCH extends the NMF framework by using a graph regularization term that (Cai et al. 2011) encourages nearby genomic regions in similar chromatin state or with similar insulator binding pattern to converge to a similar low-dimensional state. Our results show that GRiNCH can recover clusters with TAD-like properties whose boundaries show a significant association with the presence of CTCF binding. Compared to existing TAD-finding methods, GRiNCH clusters are more stable to sparse and low-depth Hi-C datasets. Finally, through a matrix completion process, GRiNCH can impute missing interaction counts and offer a smoothed Hi-C matrix comparable in quality to smoothing process employed by methods like HiCRep (Yang et al. 2017). Taken together, GRiNCH offers a promising approach to mining biologically meaningful structural domains of the genome.

Analysis of Hi-C data has shown that the genome is organized into higher-order organizational units such as compartments and topologically associated domains (TADs). We present a non-negative matrix factorization approach, commonly used for clustering and dimensionality reduction, to infer clusters of regions from Hi-C data. To preserve the spatial dependency of Hi-C data (i.e. closer regions interact more with each other), we impose regularization on NMF with the nearest-neighbor graph of each genomic loci. Our results show that NMF and graph-regularized NMF are both important to discover clusters that exhibit a significant association with the presence of CTCF binding at the cluster boundaries and are robust to simulated sparsity and lower sequence depth.","tags":["Dimension Reduction","3D Genome"],"title":"A graph-regularized non-negative matrix factorization method to discover organizational units of chromosomes","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Da-Inn Erika Lee","Jeremy Kofoot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524747600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524747600,"objectID":"fb99143bca0ef192948279ebea491e7c","permalink":"/talk/2018qonnections/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018qonnections/","section":"talk","summary":"*How a distributed stakeholder model empowers self-service analytics*","tags":["Electronic Health Records","Data Visualization"],"title":"It takes a village to raise a dashboard","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Da-Inn Erika Lee","Suzy Greblo","Alex Harrington"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519736400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519736400,"objectID":"fb1ce26d281c68953b71c35a5ed8d0de","permalink":"/outreach/2018uwhealth-fblive/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/outreach/2018uwhealth-fblive/","section":"outreach","summary":"Facebook live event for promoting career opportunities at UW Health Enterprise Analytics.","tags":[],"title":"Big Data, Big Opportunities","type":"outreach"},{"authors":["Erika Da-Inn Lee","Christopher R Turner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516971600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516971600,"objectID":"15fb02f729fd7571d37550b65ccced2a","permalink":"/talk/2018asa/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018asa/","section":"talk","summary":"With operating rooms being one of the top revenue sources in the acute-care setting, it is crucial to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as case volume, room turnover, and block utilization in order to maximize efficiency.
